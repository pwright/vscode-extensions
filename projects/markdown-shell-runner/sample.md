# Markdown Shell Runner Sample

This is a sample markdown file to test the Markdown Shell Runner extension.

## Shell Script Example

Place your cursor inside the code block below and look for the "â–¶ Run" button above the code block, or right-click to select "Run Shell Code Block":

```bash
echo "Hello, World!"
echo "Current directory:"
pwd
echo "Files in current directory:"
ls -la
```

The commands above will be executed from the directory where this markdown file is located.

## Another Example with Shell

```shell
# This is a shell script
echo "Current date and time:"
date
echo "System information:"
uname -a
```

## Example with sh

```sh
# This is an sh script
echo "Environment variables:"
env | grep PATH
echo "Working directory (should be the directory of this markdown file):"
pwd
```

## Example with zsh (if available)

```zsh
# This is a zsh script (will only work if zsh is installed)
echo "ZSH version:"
zsh --version 2>/dev/null || echo "ZSH not installed"
```

## Non-executable Code Block

This code block should not be executable by the extension (no run button should appear):

```javascript
console.log("This is JavaScript, not a shell script");
```

## Using the Run Button

The run button appears above shell code blocks and allows you to execute the code with a single click. This is a convenient way to run shell scripts without having to use the context menu.

## Working Directory

All commands are executed from the directory where the markdown file is located. This means that relative file paths in your commands will be resolved relative to the markdown file, not the workspace root.

For example, if your markdown file is located at `/path/to/docs/example.md`, and you run the following command:

```bash
ls -la
```

It will list the files in the `/path/to/docs/` directory.

## Disabling the Run Button

If you prefer not to see the run button, you can disable it in the extension settings:

1. Open VS Code settings (File > Preferences > Settings)
2. Search for "Markdown Shell Runner"
3. Uncheck the "Enable Code Lens" option
