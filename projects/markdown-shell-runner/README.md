# Markdown Shell Runner

A Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to run shell scripts directly from markdown code blocks.

## Features

- Run shell scripts from markdown code blocks with a simple run button or right-click
- Supports `shell`, `bash`, `sh`, and `zsh` code blocks
- View command output in a dedicated output channel
- Configurable supported languages

## Usage

### Using the Run Button

1. Open a markdown file in VS Code
2. Look for the "â–¶ Run" button that appears above shell code blocks:

   ![Run Button](images/run-button.png)

3. Click the run button to execute the code block
4. View the output in the "Markdown Shell Runner" output channel

### Using the Context Menu

1. Open a markdown file in VS Code
2. Place your cursor inside a shell code block like:

   ````markdown
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, World!"
   ls -la
   ```
   ````

3. Right-click and select "Run Shell Code Block" from the context menu
4. View the output in the "Markdown Shell Runner" output channel
