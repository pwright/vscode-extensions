# Markdown Shell Runner

A Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to run shell scripts directly from markdown code blocks.

## Features

- Run shell scripts from markdown code blocks with a simple run button or right-click
- Supports `shell`, `bash`, `sh`, and `zsh` code blocks
- Execute commands in dedicated terminals or view output in the output channel
- Each markdown file gets its own terminal for running commands
- Configurable supported languages
- Commands are executed from the directory of the markdown file

## Usage

### Using the Run Button

1. Open a markdown file in VS Code
2. Look for the "â–¶ Run" button that appears above shell code blocks:

   ![Run Button](images/run-button.png)

3. Click the run button to execute the code block
4. The command will run in a dedicated terminal named "Markdown Shell Runner (index)"

### Using the Context Menu

1. Open a markdown file in VS Code
2. Place your cursor inside a shell code block like:

   ````markdown
   ```bash
   echo "Hello, World!"
   ls -la
   ```
   ````

3. Right-click and select "Run Shell Code Block" from the context menu
4. The command will run in a dedicated terminal

### Terminal Management

- Each markdown file gets its own dedicated terminal
- Terminals are named "Markdown Shell Runner (index)" where index starts from 0
- When you run commands from the same file, they will reuse the same terminal
- When you run commands from a different file, a new terminal will be created with an incremented index
